                    <h3>How old does my child have to be?</h3>
                    <p>Our students typically range from 11-18, but we do make exceptions on a case-by-case basis for very mature 9 and 10 year olds.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h3>Is there homework?</h3>
                    <p>There is no required homework. However, students often freely chose to continue working on their projects at home for fun.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h3>Does my child need to bring a computer?</h3>
                    <p>We provide computers for students. However, some students chose to bring their own computers because they are more comfortable working on them.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h3>Where do you offer classes?</h3>
                    <p>We currently offer classes at Macaulay Honors College at 67th and Columbus Avenue, at Marymount School of NY at 97th and Lexington Avenue, and the 92nd St Y at 92nd and Lexington Avenue. We rent space at these locations for the times that classes are offered. Please contact us if you’d like us to expand to other locations in the City.</p>

                    <h3>What does my child learn?</h3>
                    <p>At Coding Space, our goal is to teach critical thinking, problem solving and instill a life-long love of learning and building. We help students develop grit and intellectual confidence, two character strengths that will aid students greatly in other STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) subjects. Our students learn the thought patterns and mindsets of programmers, including modeling, debugging, sequential thinking, top-down design, the design processes, test-driven development, and more. On the face of it, your child will learn how to make increasingly-complex Scratch and Javascript applications, but behind the scenes they will be growing so much more than that.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h3>What will my child be able to do after this course?</h3>
                    <p>All of our classes are self-paced, so there are no pre-determined final projects or skills at the end of our courses. Generally speaking, your student will be able to build arbitrarily-complex Scratch and Javascript applications, from Flappy Bird to FourSquare and anything in between. Because our courses are project-based but NOT tutorial-driven, after your child completes a Coding Space project, they are (by definition) now able to complete that project (because they already completed it).</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h3>Does my child need to have any prior coding experience?</h3>
                    <p>No, Coding Space’s curriculum is designed for students with any level of prior experience, including none!</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h3>What programming languages will my student be learning?</h3>
                    <p>Learning to code isn’t about learning the syntax of a particular language! It’s about learning how to think like a programmer and have the foundational skills necessary to learn any new programming language within a day, if not sooner. We pride ourselves at Coding Space for teaching those skills, so it doesn’t really matter what actual languages your student program in with us. However, if you’re still curious, our projects are in Scratch for beginner students and JavaScript for advanced students.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h3>How does the application work?</h3>
                    <p>In order to ensure a quality program, we have a limited number of students that we can accept. After you fill out our application, we will contact you shortly with what times are still available or your spot on the waiting list.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h3>My student has programmed before. Will this class still be challenging for him or her?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, Coding Space offers curriculum that would be challenging and engaging to all students who aren't already professional software engineers or Computer Science majors in college.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h3>What does the program cost?</h3>
                    <p>The program costs $1,200 per semester (24 classroom hours).</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h3>When was Coding Space founded?</h3>
                    <p>Steve and Eli have been teaching tech classes since 2013. Coding Space was founded in early 2015.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h3>How many instructors are there per student? </h3>
                    <p>We maintain a ratio of 1:10 instructors to students, though it’s often less than this.</p>
                  </li>
